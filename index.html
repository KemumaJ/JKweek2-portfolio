        <p class="main_content">Naming of children in some West African countries like Ghana, Ivory coast and Togo is derived from the day of the week the child is born.
            In Ghana, the Akan people are given their first name as 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.
           
            I know you are curious to know your Akan.  Enter your birthdate and gender below to see the day you were born and your corresponding Akan name.</p>
