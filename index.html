            <h1>Akan Names</h1>

            <p class="par">Naming of children is considered a very special ceremony in most parts of the world. For instance, in Ghana,
                Ivory coast and Togo, a child is named according to the day of the week they are born.
                <br> The Akan people from Ghana 
                are given their first name as 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they <br> were born.
                Curious to know your Akan name?....<br><br><br>Enter the day, month and year you were born and submit!</p>
